### ðŸ“Š **COVID-19 Vaccination Analysis â€“ Power BI & SQL Project**

Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of global COVID-19 vaccination trends using two powerful tools:

* **Power BI** for interactive visualizations and dashboards.
* **SQL (pgAdmin)** for in-depth data querying and analysis.

**Power BI Highlights**
* Global vaccination trend by month
* Daily vaccinations per million by country
* Total vaccinations by country
* Count of vaccines used globally
* map showing total vaccinations per hundred

#### ðŸ§® **SQL Analysis (6 Key Queries)**

1. **Most Vaccinated Country (Per Capita)** â€“ Finds the country with the highest vaccination rate relative to population.
2. **Countries with Continuous Vaccination >30 Days** â€“ Identifies countries with uninterrupted campaigns.
3. **Total Global Vaccines Administered** â€“ Calculates total doses administered globally.
4. **Peak Daily Vaccinations per Country** â€“ Detects the maximum number of doses given in a single day per country.
5. **Countries Using >3 Vaccine Types** â€“ Lists countries using a diverse set of vaccines.
6. **Daily Average Vaccinations â€“ Top 5 Countries** â€“ Shows top countries with consistent high vaccination rates.

#### âœ… **Conclusion**

Combining **Power BI visual storytelling** with **SQL analytical depth** strengthens the accuracy, insights, and impact of the data. This dual-tool approach offers a holistic view of the global vaccination effort.
